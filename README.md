# WhaleBot üêã

WhaleBot is a Discord bot that provides inspirational quotes and helps you track weight. It was inspired by the character Charlie from the movie 'The Whale'.

## Usage

WhaleBot supports the following commands:

```
@Whalebot recordWeight <weight>
@Whalebot stats
@Whalebot inspire
@Whalebot help
@Whalebot dumpDB
```

You can also run Whale bot in REPL mode (if you want to mess with it locally or test during development) like so:

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

## Planned Features

WhaleBot will support the following features in the future:
* Weight tracking and statistics
* Conversational ability using a combination of techniques like sentiment-analysis and large language models.


## Bot Architecture

* The bot runs on a single micro EC2 instance and makes use of GitHub actions and AWS CodeDeploy to deploy any changes into the `main` branch.
* The bot makes use of SQLite for its tracking functionality and creates a DB file in the `$HOME` directory of the host it is running on. This may change in the future if scaling is a concern to a hosted SQL/noSQL data store. At present the SQLite use makes developing, and forking/deploying a new instance trivial for lightweight use.
* Since the bot is light-weight and serves one personal Discord server, [`pm2`](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is used for process management with no load-balancing set up.
